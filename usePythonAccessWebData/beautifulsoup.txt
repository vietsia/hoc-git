from BeautifulSoup import *



This course uses Python 2.x and the version of Beautiful Soup supported for this course is BeautifulSoup 3.

The sample code for this course that you find at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/ (urllinks.py, etc) and the files provided for this week's assignments are written in Python 2.x and use BeautifulSoup version 3. To use this sample code, you should download Beautiful Soup from

http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/BeautifulSoup.py

and place it in the same folder as your programs that use the command:



1
from BeautifulSoup import *
No other installation steps are required.

BeautifulSoup 3 is specifically written for Python 2.x and will not work in Python 3.x. Students who choose to use Python 3.x for the assignments will have to download and figure out how to install BeautifulSoup 4.

You can download BeautifulSoup 4 from http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ and follow the instructions there for installation. You will also need to adapt our sample code to make it work with the Python 3.0 BeautifulSoup library. The syntax will be different and that syntax is not supported by the course materials. Please note that the staff will not be able to help you with any issues you might encounter using either Python 3.x or BeautifulSoup 4.
